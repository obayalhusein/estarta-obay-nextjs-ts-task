## Hello Estarta :)
This is Next js project on Typescript language, I was trying to show an example of (SSR, SSR, Static) on 3 diffrenet pages, but I didn't have time to finish it.

### Dependencies:
- Material UI
- Material UI DataTable
- Material UI Datepicker
- Moment js
- Typescript

### Deployment
I usually deploy my project Digital Ocean for deploying my projects, but I decided to try **Vercel** this time

##### Demo link

### Notes:
- There is interfaces for the API response and filter search to add extra validation using
- If I had more time I could create form validator from scratch for the input fields
- Split the homepage into a smaller and scalable components
- Move the API to a seprate file and add Axios with configration setup
- Improve the filter Big(O) (I could use 1 filter to make it faster, but I need the code to be readable for now)
- Use Memo to avoid re-rendering the page
- Fill the input fields from the query params on refresh
- Add reset button to the filter
- Create setup Material UI with custom theme
- It took me 2 days to create this project it's been 2 years for me without using React.js
